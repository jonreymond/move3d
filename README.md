## installation
Make sure to have installed Conda or miniconda in your machine. Then run `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
You could also use mamba to build the environment quicker. First, run `conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba` if mamba is not installed, then `mamba env create -f environment.yml`.
